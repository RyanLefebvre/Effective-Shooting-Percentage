## Effective Shooting Percentage
Unlike youth, high school and collegiate lacrosse, professional field lacrosse leagues have created 
a "two point line". If a player stands behind this line when shooting, a goal is worth two points 
instead of one. Effective Shooting Percentage (ES%) is a new lacrosse statistic that accounts for the 
fact that a two point goal is worth more than a one point goal. 

ES% = ( OnePointGoals + ( 2 * TwoPointGoals ) ) / TotalShotAttempts   

## Motivation
ES% is inspired by a relatively new and powerful statistic in basketball called effective field goal 
percentage ( EFG% ). EFG% accounts for the fact that three point shots are worth more than 
two point shots. EFG% has been a significant predicator of a teams offensive performance: for 
example in 2013, the Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs had the highest EFG% and in the league and 
ended up meeting in the NBA finals that year. This project aims to explore if a similar relationship 
between scoring efficiency and team/player success exists in professional lacrosse.
