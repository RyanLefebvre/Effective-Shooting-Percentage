For example there may be a table that contains all of the players on a team and the id for that table might be "playerTable". The gamesheets however had almost no elements with attributes that could be used to locate important information. Instead, I ended up creating a list of all the tables in the page and figuring out the indexes of where the information I needed would be in that list through trial and error.

This makes all of our statistics of interest impossible to calculate. I filtered these games out of the data for the regression analysis but left them in the datsets I exported to csv format.
