In game three they played the worst team in the league. This teams goalie couldn't stop a beach ball and our imaginary team shot very well. Respectively over the 3 games they shot 3/12, 2/16 and 18/27.

While the difference between absolute and average shooting percentage for this example may appear small at only 7%, the relative decrease from absolute to average is 17% which is a more significant difference. This has to do with why the average shooting percentage is a more accurate representation of how we would expect a given team to shoot.
