This was harder than usual because the gamesheets were layed out in an interesting way. In general when scraping html files you will look for id or class attributes of html elements to use to locate important information. For example there may be a table that contains all of the players on a team and the id for that table might be "playerTable". The gamesheets however had almost no elements with attributes that could be used to locate important information. Instead, I ended up creating a list of all the tables in the page and figuring out the indexes of where the information I needed would be in that list through trial and error.
